# This cmake template file can be used to create a small shell script which can
# be used to simplify the Python development process. The cmake step will create
# script setup-install.sh from this templated file - that script can be used to
# run the installation through the setup.py macinery without going through
# cmake.
#
# The script in question is purely a convenience for Python development, it is
# fully optional to use it, and it is not used by the main cmake based build
# system.
